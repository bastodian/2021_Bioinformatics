Heuristic search settings:
  Optimality criterion = likelihood
    1523 characters are included
    All characters have equal weight
    Likelihood settings:
      Current model:
                               Data type = nucleotide
                  DNA substitution types = 6
                       Exchangeabilities = AC=1.27388 AG=1.77081 AT=0.604294 CG=1.4554 CT=3.20446 GT=1
                       State frequencies = equal
          Proportion of invariable sites = none
                 Rates at variable sites = gamma, shape=0.4512 (4 categories [mean])
                    Model correspondence = SYM+G

      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 119
      Molecular clock not enforced
      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
      Trees with approximate log likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional
        iteration
      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, tolerance=1e-07
      Likelihood calculations performed in single precision
      Vector processing enabled
      Using standard Felsenstein pruning for computing likelihoods
      Conditional-likelihood rescaling threshold = 1e-20
      Using 1 thread on 4 physical (8 logical) processors

  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
    Addition sequence: random
    Number of replicates = 5
    Starting seed = generated automatically
    Number of trees held at each step = 1
  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
    Steepest descent option not in effect
  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100 (will be auto-increased by 100)
  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-08
  'MulTrees' option in effect
  No topological constraints in effect
  Trees are unrooted

Heuristic search completed
  Total number of rearrangements tried = 12
  Score of best tree(s) found = 4531.912
  Number of trees retained = 1
  Time used = 0.02 sec (CPU time = 0.02 sec)
